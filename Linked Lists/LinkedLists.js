// Linked lists have a loose structure allowing you to insert value into middle by resetting a few pointers. Only changes that happen are somewhere in the middle - same goes for deleting something in a list.
// main difference is arrays have indexes. Link Lists use traversal until you get to said index.
// Traversal - You don't know when the linked list end - continue auntil code hits null.
