### NOTES:
- Linked lists have a loose structure allowing you to insert value into middle by resetting a few pointers. Only changes that happen are somewhere in the middle - same goes for deleting something in a list.
- main difference is arrays have indexes. Link Lists use traversal until you get to said index.
- Traversal - You don't know when the linked list end - continue until code hits null.

- made up of nodes, each node consists of data and next pointer.

Advantages of Linked List:
there is no size limitation
Insertion and deletion is easy

Disadvantages of Linked List:
sequential access (in array you can just go directly to index)
Extra pointer - nodes hold extra size to store next pointer
