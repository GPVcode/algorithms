//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
//Breadth First Search


//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
//Breadth First Search - DFS wuld take very long

//If the tree is very wide:
//Depth First Search - BFS would take too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
//Depth First Search

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
//Depth First Search

//Finding the shortest path:
// Breadth First Search
