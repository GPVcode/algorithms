# Lesson Plan: Algorithms - "Alternating Merge of Strings"

# Objective: By the end of today's lesson, students will be able to understand and implement the logic behind merging two strings alternately and recognize its time and space complexities.

# Engage:
Who likes weaving? When we weave, we alternate strands to create something new, right? Today, we're going to weave with words, or more specifically, characters in strings!

##LeetCode Problem 1768: Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string runs out of letters, append the remaining letters of the other string.

Example:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"

Output: "apbqcr"

Explain:

Understanding the Problem:

We want to take characters from word1 and word2 alternately and combine them.
If one word finishes before the other, just append the remaining characters of the other word.
Algorithm:

Use two pointers, one for each string.
As long as either pointer hasnâ€™t reached the end of its string, take a character from word1 if possible, then word2 if possible.
Coding the Solution:
```
python

def mergeAlternately(word1, word2):
    res = []   # This will store our merged characters.
    i, j = 0, 0  # Two pointers, one for each word.
    
    # While either word has characters left.
    while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
        if i < len(word1):
            res.append(word1[i])
            i += 1
        if j < len(word2):
            res.append(word2[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Join the characters together to get the result string.
    return ''.join(res)
```
# Time and Space Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively.
Reason: We are just traversing each string once.
Space Complexity: O(n + m) for the output. The algorithm itself uses O(1) space apart from the output.
Extend/Elaborate:

# Engage 
Why is this useful? Imagine building a tool for designers where they want to merge patterns from two designs. This algorithm can help with that! The world of algorithms is all around us!

# Evaluate:

Teacher: "Let's try a couple of problems to practice!"

word1 = "apple", word2 = "orange"
word1 = "hello", word2 = "world"

### Summary:
Great job today! We've taken two strings and merged them together, taking characters alternately. This is not just about merging words but about understanding the pattern and applying it elsewhere. Keep looking for patterns in the world around you!

Keep the Spark Alive: Inspire them to think of where else alternating patterns might be useful. Maybe in music, art, or some game they play? Algorithms are everywhere, and the ability to see the world algorithmically is a superpower!
